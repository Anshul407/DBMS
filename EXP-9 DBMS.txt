EXP-9 INDEXES AND CURSOR

INDEX:-it is a db structure associated with table to allows the db system to quickly locate and access the specific row of db

CURSOR:
IT IS a db object that allows you to retrieve and manipulate row of data in a result set of return sql queries.
Cursors allow us to process data row-by-row, which can be useful when we need to perform complex calculations or transformations on the data.
Cursors allow us to iterate over a result set multiple times, which can be useful when we need to perform multiple operations on the same data.
Cursors can be useful when we need to join multiple tables with complex relationships, such as when processing hierarchical data structures or when performing recursive queries.


IMplicit cursor
automatically created and managed by dbms
syntax:
DECLARE VARIABLE datatype;
SELECT COL{ROW} INTO VARIABLE FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE CONDITION;

Explicit cursor
cursor which are created manually and managed by user

DECLARE 
CURSOR C_NAME IS SELECT COL_NAME
FROM TB_NAME WHERE COND;
VAR_NAME DATATYPE;
BEGIN 
OPEN CURSOR NAME;
LOOP
FETCH CURSOR NAME INTO VARNAME
EXIT WHEN CONDITION
END LOOP;
CLOSE CURSOR_NAME;
END;
